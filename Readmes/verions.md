*What is the most difference between Angular 2 to 4?*
- The generation of the file reduce by 60 percent, therefore making you code run faster;
- Support for Typescript 2.1;
- When you generate a new project using the CLI, this is built in;
- In Angular 4 animation library have been pulled out of the Angular code library, so when you need to use the animations, you need to import browser animation module, and then use it in _ngModule_;
- In Angular 4 now you can use _else_ with _ngIf_
- In Angular 4 use _ng-template_ instead of just _template_

## What are Single Page Applications? 
When start navigating around, you will see that the page does not fully
reload – only new data gets sent over the wire as the user navigates
through the application – that is an example of a single page
application.


### Advantages and Downsides
A single page application is super-simple to deploy if compared to more traditional server-side rendered applications: it's really just one index.html file, with a CSS bundle and a Javascript bundle.

The main advanteges is better user experience and an improvement in perceived performance.
